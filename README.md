- **RNA-seq pipeline**: FastQC quality control, read trimming (Trimmomatic, Fastp), genome/transcriptome mapping and indexing (STAR, HISAT2, Salmon), read counting (FeatureCounts), quality report aggregation (MultiQC), differential expression analysis (pyDESeq2, multi-contrast)
- **Functional enrichment**: over-representation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), GAF-to-GMT gene set conversion, gene ID conversion
- **KEGG pathway analysis**: KEGG enrichment with Pathview visualization
- **Genome visualization**: circular genome plots (pyCirclize), comparative genome visualization (pyGenomeViz)
- **Phylogenetics**: tree construction (IQ-TREE) and tree visualization (phyTreeViz)

## 🛠️ Installation

The `gws_omix` brick requires the `gws_core` brick.

### 🔥 Recommended Method

The best way to install a brick is through the Constellab platform. With our Fair Open Access offer, you get a free cloud data lab where you can install bricks directly. [Sign up here](https://constellab.space/)

Learn about the data lab here : [Overview](https://constellab.community/bricks/gws_academy/latest/doc/digital-lab/overview/294e86b4-ce9a-4c56-b34e-61c9a9a8260d) and [Data lab management](https://constellab.community/bricks/gws_academy/latest/doc/digital-lab/on-cloud-digital-lab-management/4ab03b1f-a96d-4d7a-a733-ad1edf4fb53c)

### 🔧 Manual installation

This section is for users who want to install the brick manually. It can also be used to install the brick manually in the Constellab Codelab.

We recommend installing using Ubuntu 22.04 with python 3.10.

#### Usage


▶️ To start the server :

```bash
gws server run
```

🕵️ To run a given unit test

```bash
gws server test [TEST_FILE_NAME]
```

Replace `[TEST_FILE_NAME]` with the name of the test file (without `.py`) in the tests folder. Execute this command in the folder of the brick.

🕵️ To run the whole test suite, use the following command:

```bash
gws server test all
```

📌 VSCode users can use the predefined run configuration in `.vscode/launch.json`.
